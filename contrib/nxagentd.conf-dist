#
# Sample configuration file for NetXMS agent
#

#
# Servers
#
# List of management servers which have read access to this agent.
# Both IP addresses and DNS names can be used. Multiple servers can be
# specified in one line, separated by commas. If this parameter used more
# than once, servers listed in all occurences will have access to agent.
#
# Examples:
# Servers = 10.0.0.1
# Servers = 127.0.0.1, srv1.domain.com, srv2.domain.com

#
# InstallationServers
#
# List of management servers which can upload files to agent and initiate
# agent upgrade. Hosts listed in this parameter also have read access to agent.
# Both IP addresses and DNS names can be used. Multiple servers can be
# specified in one line, separated by commas. If this parameter used more
# than once, servers listed in all occurences will have access to agent.
#
# Examples:
# InstallationServers = 10.0.0.1
# InstallationServers = 127.0.0.1, srv1.domain.com, srv2.domain.com

#
# LogFile
#
# Agent's log file. To write log to syslog (or Event Log on Windows),
# use {syslog} as file name.
#
# Examples:
# LogFile = {syslog}
# LogFile = /var/log/nxagentd.log

#
# RequireAuthentication
#
# If set to "yes", host connected to agent have to provide correct shared
# secret before issuing any command. Default value is "no".
#
# Example:
# RequireAuthentication = no

#
# SharedSecret
#
# Agent's shared secret. Used only if RequireAuthentication set to "yes".
#
# Example:
# SharedSecret = secret

#
# FileStore
#
# Directory to be used for storing files uploaded by installation server(s).
#
# Example:
# FileStore = /var/nxagentd

#
# TimeOut
#
# GET request timeout in seconds. If GET request cannot be completed for
# specified amount of time, agent will return an error to server.
# Default value is 5 seconds.
#
# Example:
# TimeOut = 5

#
# StartupDelay
#
# Number of seconds agent should wait on startup before start servicing
# requests. This parameter can be useful to prevent false reports about
# missing processes or failed services just after monitored system startup.
# Default value is 0, i.e. no startup delay.
#
# Example:
# StartupDelay = 0

#
# PlatformSuffix
#
# String to be added as suffix to value of System.PlatformName parameter.
#
# Example:
# PlatformSuffix = dbg

#
# SubAgent
#
# Subagent to load. To load multiple subagents, you should use multiple
# SubAgent parameters. Subagents will be loaded in the same order as they
# appears in configuration file.
#
# UNIX example:
# SubAgent = [path_to_netxms_install_dir]/lib/libnsm_linux.so
#
# Windows example:
# SubAgent = winperf.nsm

#
# ExternalParameter
#
# Add parameter handled by external command. To add multiple parameters, you
# should use multiple ExternalParameter entries.
# 
# Syntax:
# ExternalParameter = <parameter_name>:<command_line>
# If you specify parameter name as "name(*)", then you can use $1 .. $9 in
# command line to substitute actual arguments passed from server.
#
# Examples:
# ExternalParameter = Test:echo test
# ExternalParameter = LineCount(*):cat $1 | wc -l
# ExternalParameter = Test2(*):myprog $1 $2

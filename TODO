 Current NetXMS ToDo List
**************************


GENERAL:

- Fix bugs in ConditionWait()
- Finish Linux subagent
- Finish FreeBSD subagent
- Finish Solaris subagent
- AIX subagent
- HP-UX subagent
- Cross-platform pinger subagent
- Write README for NetWare
- SMS-sender interface with drivers for cell-phones/SMPP
- Add check for read/write locks support to configure script
- Allow converting counters to deltas in data collection
- Add ability to clear collected DCI data
- Add possibility to set different polling timeouts for different nodes
- Optimize WaitForMessage method in message waiting queue class
- Rewrite event management in a way to eliminate the need to unlock
  event configuration to allow sending of new events
- View and update agent's configuration from server
- Add diff() method for DCI thresholds
- Planned outages (maintenance schedule)
- NxAdm -- status, stop server
- NxDbMgr -- backup before db recover


SERVER:

- Recalculate object status after binding change
- Implement sending of all alarms from database
- Implement normal mailer shutdown
- Check if object indexes always locked when used
- Remove system-dependent code for getting interface list and ARP cache
  from management server. Server should rely on SNMP or native agent for
  this functionality.
- Chech if ObjectGlobalLock()/ObjectGlobalUnlock() really needed or we can
  use just index locking
- Check what happens if DCI copied while being polled
- On startup, server must read last poll time from database for each DCI
- Optimize SNMP subsystem
- Add special handling for HP iLO boards
- Multiple status pollers
- Housekeeping for DCI
- Add logging API for database drivers
- DCI transformation scripts (probably Perl?)
- Add database unlocking after server crash into nxdbmgr
- Event correlation
- Internal parameters for service checks
- "Proxy agent for service checks" attribure for node objects
- Gather list of supported parameters from agent in configuration poller
- Implement reconnect in all database drivers
- Network service autodiscovery
- New attribute: disable status/configuration poll
- Override Net.IP.Forward
- Looks like object not marked as modified when platform name or agent
  version changes
- Bug: after server restart, all empty key and ack_key fields in EPP contains
  strings of one space character instead of empty string, which cause
  very interesting effects with alarms autoacknowlegement


CORE AGENT:

- Check shutdown procedure on different platforms
- Remote config editing


LINUX AGENT:

- Return correct interface type in Net.InterfaceList
- Implement Net.IP.NextHop and Net.IP.RoutingTable


FREEBSD AGENT:

- Return correct interface type in Net.InterfaceList
- Implement Net.IP.NextHop and Net.IP.RoutingTable


SOLARIS AGENT:

- Implement Net.IP.NextHop and Net.IP.RoutingTable


WINDOWS CONSOLE:

- Automatically select data type in DCI configuration dialog based on
  selected parameter
- Add parameter selection for native agents in DCI configuration dialog
- Find good graph creation library
- Enlarge 16x16 status overlay icons
- Add primary IP address selection 
- Add real-time graphs
- Play sound on new alarms
- Add sorting to all list views
- Add "Copy value to clipboard" to "Collected data" window
- Event Processing Policy: Edit with doubleclick
- Event Processing Policy: Disable record with doubleclick on leftmost field (number)


SUBAGENTS:

- libperl-driven subagent, allow to run perl scripts w/o forking/executing
- bandwidth meter; data in/out for last N seconds


CLIENT LIBRARY:

- Add locks to functions which calls PrepareForSync()/WaitForSync()
